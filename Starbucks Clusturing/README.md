## Logic

The logic behind coupon distribution is as follows:

- Coupons for all hot beverages are offered when sales are low to stimulate sales.
- Coupons for non-sale hot beverages are offered during times of good sales to encourage customers to try new items.

## Implemented Clustering Algorithms

The clustering algorithms used in this project are:

- Single Link Clustering: [[Single_Link_Starbucks.ipynb](Single_Link_Starbucks.ipynb)](https://github.com/HarshNVyas/ML-Projects/blob/main/Starbucks%20Clusturing/Single_Link_Starbucks.ipynb)
- Average Link Clustering: [[Average_Link_Starbucks.ipynb](Average_Link_Starbucks.ipynb)](https://github.com/HarshNVyas/ML-Projects/blob/main/Starbucks%20Clusturing/Average_Link_Starbucks.ipynb)
- Complete Link Clustering: [[Complete_Link_Starbucks.ipynb](Complete_Link_Starbucks.ipynb)
