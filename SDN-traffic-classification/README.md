# Software Defined Network Traffic Classification

This project focuses on the classification of Software Defined Network (SDN) traffic using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The dataset used for classification is generated using Python code and a Ryu controller, with network topologies created in Mininet.

## Methodologies

The classification is performed using the following Machine Learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbors

The implementation details and results for each algorithm are provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks.

## Results

Here's a summary of the results obtained:
